### About the game making experience:

This was another follow along project I put together to gain more knowledge 
about python classes and how they work in pygame. This project was a combo
of learning more about sprite and sprite groups and how collision detection 
works with in a pygame group. It was still an aweesome project to follow
along to and really get to learn some new features of pygame. 
I am excited for my next project!

### Image, Music and Design Shout-outs:

The game loop design was used from a UDEMY corse lead by Michael Eramo. This gme design is based
off a game he created call Feed The Dragon and can be found in his corse call:
The Art of Doing: Video Game Creation With Python and Pygame
